# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning & NLP

Detect fake news articles using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques. This project demonstrates the end-to-end application of supervised learning and text processing pipelines using Python.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* ✅ Advanced **text preprocessing** with tokenization, stopword removal, stemming
* ✅ **Feature extraction** using TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words models
* ✅ Model training using **Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes**, and more
* ✅ Evaluates with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
* ✅ Simple Flask web deployment (optional)

## 📈 Model Training & Usage

* Open `Untitled.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
* Load and preprocess the dataset.
* Train multiple models and compare performance.
* Evaluate using confusion matrix and accuracy metrics.
* (Optional) Use Flask to deploy as a web tool.

## 📊 Results

* Achieved **90%+ accuracy** using Logistic Regression with TF-IDF.
* Naive Bayes also showed strong generalization on unseen data.
* Demonstrated robust handling of noisy textual data.
